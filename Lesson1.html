 		<p>When Orchestre Metropolitain heard about it, they knew they wanted to help. </p>
 		<p>They got in touch with a local violin shop and bought him a new instrument. </p>

          <p>They hand-delivered the Gewa violin, with a new case and bow, to Landry on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
          <p>"When we heard what happened to you, we contacted our friends at Maison du Violon...and we decided to give you back your joie-de-vivre and give you back the opportunity to do what it is you do best, which allows you to earn a small living," Jean Dupré, president of L'Orchestre Métropolitain, told Landry. </p>

          <p>Francis Lapointe of the Maison du Violon, who offered to sell it at cost price, said they wanted to help "put music back in his life."</p>
          <p>"He will have everything he needs to be playing again," Lapointe said. "It's a good instrument and it's going to work for years, hopefully, for Mark to enjoy his music and for us to enjoy his music also."</p>

          <h3>'Lower level of poverty' without violin</h3>
          <p>Landry says he was disappointed to wake up this morning and realize his violin was gone.</p>
          <p>"I just said, 'OK, I gotta go through the lower level of poverty, which is to live without my violin.'"</p>
          <p>But Landry said he never had a doubt that he would get his hands on a violin again.</p>
          <p>"I said, 'God's gonna give me a new one.'"</p>

          <p>"We hope that it gives you your smile back," Dupré told Landry, who has been playing the violin since he was 17.</p>
          <p>"Oh yeah!" Landry said. "I'm going to go play right away."​</p>
